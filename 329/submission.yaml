comment: We report results on the total and elastic cross sections in proton-proton
  collisions at $\sqrt{s}=200$~GeV obtained with the Roman Pot setup of the STAR experimentat
  the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC).The elastic differential cross section
  was measured in the squared four-momentum transfer range $0.045 \leq -t \leq 0.135$~GeV$^2$.The
  value of the exponential slope parameter $B$ of the elastic differential cross section
  $d\sigma/dt \sim e^{-Bt}$ in the measured $-t$ rangewas found to be $B = 14.32 \pm
  0.09 (stat.)^{\scriptstyle +0.13}_{\scriptstyle -0.28} (syst.)$~GeV$^{-2}$. The
  total cross section $\sigma_{tot}$, obtained from extrapolation of the $d\sigma/dt$
  to the optical point at $-t = 0$, is $\sigma_{tot} = 54.67 \pm 0.21 (stat.) ^{\scriptstyle
  +1.28}_{\scriptstyle -1.38} (syst.)$ mb.We also present the values of the elastic
  cross section $\sigma_{el} = 10.85 \pm 0.03 (stat.) ^{\scriptstyle +0.49}_{\scriptstyle
  -0.41}(syst.)$ mb,the elastic cross section integrated within the STAR $t$-range  $\sigma^{det}_{el}
  = 4.05 \pm 0.01 (stat.) ^{\scriptstyle+0.18}_{\scriptstyle -0.17}(syst.)$ mb, and
  theinelastic cross section $\sigma_{inel} = 43.82 \pm 0.21  (stat.) ^{\scriptstyle
  +1.37}_{\scriptstyle -1.44} (syst.)$ mb.The results are compared with the world
  data.
