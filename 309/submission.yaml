comment: J/PSI(1S) suppression has long been considered a sensitive signature of the
  formation of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.
  In this letter, we present the first measurement of inclusive J/PSI(1S) production
  at mid-rapidity through the dimuon decay channel in Au+Au collisions at \sqrtsNN\
  = 200 GeV with the STAR experiment. These measurements became possible after the
  installation of the Muon Telescope Detector was completed in 2014. The J/PSI(1S)
  yields are measured in a wide transverse momentum (pT) range of 0.15 GeV/c to 12
  GeV/c from central to peripheral collisions. They extend the kinematic reach of
  previous measurements at RHIC with improved precision. In the 0-10% most central
  collisions, the J/PSI(1S) yield is suppressed by a factor of approximately 3 for
  pT > 5 GeV/c relative to that in p+p collisions scaled by the number of binary nucleon-nucleon
  collisions. The J/PSI(1S) nuclear modification factor displays little dependence
  on pT in all centrality bins. Model calculations can qualitatively describe the
  data, providing further evidence for the color-screening effect experienced by J/PSI(1S)
  mesons in the QGP.
