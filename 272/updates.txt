Dear Takahito,

   Thank you for careful checking this.
   The data points on webpage are generated from Ji Xu who already left the field. He could make some mistakes when output those data points.

    Please find the attached net-kaon distributions for 0-5% and 70-80% that I re-generated from TH1D file.
    The npart value you got are right ones to use.

Thank you
Best Regards,
Xiaofeng

Dear Xiaofeng,
cc : PAC and HEPData shift coordinator,

Could you please help to solve the issues shown below for the GPC232 net-kaon paper?
https://drupal.star.bnl.gov/STAR/publications/collision-energy-dependence-moments-net-kaon-multiplicity-distributions-rhic <https://drupal.star.bnl.gov/STAR/publications/collision-energy-dependence-moments-net-kaon-multiplicity-distributions-rhic>

Fig.1
- Data points outside of the -20 ~ +20 range for central events are missing in the data tables although they are in the paper figure.
- Data points in the data tables for 70-80% peripheral events look different from the points in the paper figure.
- These two issues are the case for almost all the energies in this figure.

Fig.7 - 10
- Npart are missing in the data table. We salvaged those number in each energy from the following sources.
Could you please confirm if those Npart numbers are OK to use in HEPData.

Your help will be very much appreciated!
